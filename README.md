# imagestore

A repo demonstrating the use of M databases as a native image store.

Uses mg_python to interface Python with YottaDB/GTM/Intersystems Cache and Iris

An image passed as either a file location or a http link is passed. The image is then converted to a binary string and stored in an M database.
